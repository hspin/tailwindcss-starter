Starter
==============

> A modern kick-starter for front-end development packed with well-chosen tools


Get started
-----------

Install *"manually"* doing the following steps:

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:mantis-stack/mantis-starter.git my-project`
- Enter the folder: `cd my-project`
- Install Node dependencies: `npm install`
- Finally install Bower components: `bower install`

But I recommend you to install the easiest way.


Running
-------

You can run the app locally by [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

### Available Gulp commands

#### Default - `gulp`

Run `gulp` to compile and watch files running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Build - `gulp build`

Run `gulp build` to only compile files

#### Dist - `gulp dist`

Run `gulp dist` to compile, optimize and minify files

#### Clean - `gulp clean`

Run `gulp clean` to delete the `build/` folder (same as `rm -rf build`)
